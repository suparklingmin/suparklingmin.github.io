## 🧑‍🏫 About Me

I am a computational linguist and currently a visiting assistant professor at the College of Humanities, Seoul National University. My work lies at the intersection of linguistics, data science, and artificial intelligence, with a focus on natural language processing (NLP) in both academic and applied domains. I have led and contributed to multiple interdisciplinary research projects involving medical NLP, neural text summarization, and word embedding techniques for Korean.
